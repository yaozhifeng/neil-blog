# Writing articles as writing code

I have been quite active in writing blogs a few years ago, when the [Microsoft Live Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Spaces) service had not been stopped. It was fun to record a little bit of life on the internet and being "social", which means getting feedback from friends who has been connected through MSN Messenger. Until September 2010, Microsoft annouced that it would discontinue Live Spaces. It was a good service.

Then I migrate to wordpress. First at wordpress.com and then hosted at dreamhost.com. But actually, I stopped writing since then. 

This week, I found this: [Felix Felicis](http://lab.lepture.com/liquidluck/), a static blog generator. It is so different with wordpress kind of thing in that there's no database at all. It is just so simple and elegant and interesting, that I decide to try it and start bloging.

With [Felix Felicis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Spaces), writing blog is no longer like logging in to a web system and fighting with the so called [WISIWIG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor. Instead, now you create your article with a text editor as simple and powerful as [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), then build it, and deploy to any web server. This is definately not for everyone. This is for prgrammers, and I am a programmer. And now we have [Git](http://git-scm.com/), with which we keep our articles in version control, just as how we control our source code. And we can host our source code (aka, blog articles) on [Github](https://github.com/), as most programmers do.

I am thinking the way we blog using fancy database driven system might just simply wrong. As a programmer, now I write my articles with a source code editor, I compile it into HTML, then I publish it. Meanwhile, I source control them with Git. That is fun!
